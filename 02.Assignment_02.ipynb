The output of this multiplication is summed, and the result is passed through an activation function. The output layer generates the final output of the neuron.\n",

The basic structure of an MLP consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives the input data, and the output layer produces the output. The hidden layers contain a variable number of neurons that transform the input data before passing it to the next layer.\n",
